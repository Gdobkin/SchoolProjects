School Projects

The Christmas Project was created for a class wide competition.
It employs the DrawingPanel class which is selected JFrame commands. 
The project draws a menorah which plays music and the candle flames change colors.

The Baby Names project was my final for the sophmore year computer science class.
It also uses JFrame.
It prompts you to type a name and shows you its popularity by decade since the year 1900 in text and on a graph.
